The java programming masterclass on Udemy. Tim's naming conventions are not followed exactly. Instead, packages are organized by sections, with class names corresponding to the video/coding exercise. Note that some of the lessons and exercises for sections 3 are grouped with section 4. Sections 1 and 2 are about setup and IDE configuration, and do not have any corresponding code.
